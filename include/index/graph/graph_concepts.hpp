/**
 * @brief Concept that checks if a type T can build a graph.
 *
 * This concept ensures that any type T that is used with it has a member function
 * named `build_graph` which takes two parameters:
 * - A pointer to an array of data of type DataType (e.g., float* for vector data).
 * - An identifier of type IDType (e.g., an integer representing the number of vectors).
 *
 * @tparam T The type that is being constrained by this concept. It should have a
 *           member function `build_graph`.
 * @tparam IDType The type of the first parameter for the `build_graph` function,
 *                typically representing some identifier or size.
