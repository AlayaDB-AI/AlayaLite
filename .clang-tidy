#### Disabled checks and why: #####
#
# -clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.rand, -clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.rand, -bugprone-unhandled-self-assignment, 
#     These have not been investigated yet.
# -bugprone-too-small-loop-variable,
#     Complains about uint8_t or uint16_t when the limit on the loop is a container's .size() (size_t).
#     We usually do this when we know the maximum size of the container though, so propose leaving disabled.
# -modernize-avoid-c-arrays,
#     We use C-style arrays in vectorized computing. They're a little more ergonomic than std::array. Thoughts?
# -bugprone-exception-escape
#     Weird. No idea how to resolve.
